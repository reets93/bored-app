# Bored?

In our team, we have conceived and created our first collaborative front-end, single-page application. We have created a React front end to build a user-focused platform. We used agile development methodologies to help us work collaboratively. We stored our project code in GitHub, managing our work with a project management tool, and implemented features and bug fixes using the Git branch workflow and pull requests. We have used everything we’ve learned during the bootcamp to create a real-world client-side single-page application that we’ll be able to showcase to potential employers.
